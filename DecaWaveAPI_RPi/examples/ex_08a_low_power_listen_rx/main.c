 *  @brief   RX using low-power listening mode example code
 *
 *           This example application implements a scheme called "low-power listening". Low-power listening is a feature whereby the DW1000 is
 *           predominantly in the SLEEP state but wakes periodically for a very short time to sample the air for a preamble sequence. If a preamble is
 *           detected, the reception of the whole frame is performed normally by the DW1000. The device can then decide to interrupt low-power
 *           listening to enter any interaction mode needed. Low-power listening is then best used to infrequently wake-up a device among a population.
 *           A device using low-power listening can be woken-up using a "wake-up sequence" formed by several standard frames sent back-to-back.
 *
 *           Low-power listening scheme is formed by the repetition of the 4 following phases:
 *               - SLEEP state phase ("long sleep")
 *               - first RX ON phase
 *               - SNOOZE state phase ("short sleep")
 *               - second RX ON phase. This second phase is needed because there is a probability that the first RX ON phase happens during the
 *                 transmission of the SFD/PHR/DATA part of the current frame in the wake-up sequence or during the IFS between two frames. If the
 *                 "short sleep" duration is correctly defined depending on communication configuration and frame length, this second RX ON phase will
 *                 ensure that a preamble in the wake-up sequence can be detected.
 *
 *           See "Low-Power Listening" section in User Manual for more details.
 *
 *           This example sets up low-power listening mode and awaits to be woken-up by a wake-up sequence as sent by the companion example 9b
 *           "Low-power listening TX". When such a frame is received, this example checks if it is the intended recipient of the wake-up sequence. If
 *           so, it sleeps until the end of the wake-up sequence and then takes part in a subsequent interaction period (in this example this
 *           interaction is just a single frame transmission). Then after completing the interaction it reenters the low-power listening state. If the
 *           received wake-up sequence is addressed to another node, we sleep for a period sufficiently long that the wake up sequence and subsequent
 *           interaction are complete before we reactivate the low-power listening.

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. When using low-power listening mode, communication parameters have to be chosen carefully so that the wake-up sequence can be detected with good
 *    reliability by the listener and, at the same time, allow it not to burn too much power when receiving a frame. The configuration used in this
 *    example is a good compromise between these needs: the preamble is long enough to ease the detection of frames and the use of 6.8 Mbps data rate
 *    makes the data part of each frame quite short.
 * 2. For the same reasons than in NOTE 1 above, timings of the reception/short sleep phase have to be chosen carefully. Typically, reception time
 *    should be at least 3 PACs to be able to detect preambles with good reliability and short sleep time should be equal to (or slightly more than)
 *    the length of the (SFD + PHR + DATA) part of the frames composing the wake-up sequence in addition to the IFS between these frames. This is
 *    needed to ensure that, if the first reception phase hits in the SFD/PHR/DATA/IFS part of a wake-up sequence's frame and thus does not detect it,
 *    the second reception phase will hit a preamble. This is how the timings have been defined here.
 * 3. The sleep counter is 16 bits wide but represents the upper 16 bits of a 28 bits counter. Thus the granularity of this counter is 4096 counts.
 *    Combined with the frequency of the internal RING oscillator being typically between 7 and 13 kHz, this means that the time granularity that we
 *    get when using the timed sleep feature is typically between 315 and 585 ms. As the sleep time calculated is rounded down to the closest integer
 *    number of sleep counts, this means that the actual sleep time can be significantly less than the one defined here.
 * 4. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants in this example to keep it simple but for a real product every device should have a
 *    unique ID. Here, 16-bit addressing is used to keep the messages as short as possible but, in an actual application, this should be done only
 *    after an exchange of specific messages used to define those short addresses for each device participating to the ranging exchange.
 * 5. While a single unacknowledged transmission might be okay for some applications, in most a more involved interaction would typically occur after
 *    a wake-up.
 * 6. In this example, receive buffer is set to the exact size of the only frame we want to handle but 802.15.4 UWB standard maximum frame length is
 *    127 bytes. DW1000 also supports an extended frame length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example.
 * 7. When using SPI chip select line to wake DW1000 up (by maintaining it low for at least 500 us), we need a buffer to collect the data that DW1000
 *    outputs during the corresponding dummy SPI transaction. The length of the transaction, and then the time for which the SPI chip select is held
 *    low, is determined by the buffer length given to dwt_spicswakeup() so this length must be chosen high enough so that the DW1000 has enough time
 *    to wake up.
 * 8. In this example, LDE microcode is not loaded upon calling dwt_initialise(). This will prevent the IC from generating an RX timestamp. If
 *    time-stamping is required, DWT_LOADUCODE parameter should be used. See two-way ranging examples (e.g. examples 5a/5b).
 * 9. As the DW1000 is not woken by the reset line, we could get to this point with it asleep which means that it will not be possible to initialise
 *    it properly. But, because of the low-power listening mode configuration, it is very complex to handle the case by trying to wake the DW1000 up
 *    before initialisation. The best solution remains to power off the DW1000 when the user wants to reset it. In the case of this example running on
 *    an EVB1000 board, this means powering off the whole board.
 * 10. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *     the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW1000 OTP memory.
 * 11. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of tx_msg as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *     automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our tx_msg could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *     work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 12. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but it would also be possible to use the DW1000 interrupt
 *     triggered by TXFRS event, depending on what is the best fit for the actual system's architecture.
 * 13. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *     DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
