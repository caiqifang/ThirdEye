 *  @brief   Automatically acknowledged data TX example code
 *
 *           This is a simple code example that sends a frame and then turns on the DW1000 receiver to receive a response, expected to be an ACK
 *           frame as sent by the companion simple example "ACK DATA RX" example code. After the ACK is received, this application proceeds to the
 *           sending of the next frame (increasing the frame sequence number). If the expected valid ACK is not received, the application immediately
 *           retries to send the frame (keeping the same frame sequence number).

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. This example can be turned into a high speed data transfer test by removing the delay executed between two successful transmissions. The
 *    communication configuration and MAC payload size in the message can be changed to see the effect of the different parameters on the throughput
 *    (which can be computed using the different counters provided in the application). For example using the debugger to stop at the start of the
 *    while loop, and then timing from the "GO" for a few minutes before breaking in again, and examining the frame counters.
 * 2. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants to keep the example simple but for a real product every device should have a unique ID.
 *    For development purposes it is possible to generate a DW1000 unique ID by combining the Lot ID & Part Number values programmed into the DW1000
 *    during its manufacture. However there is no guarantee this will not conflict with someone else’s implementation. We recommended that customers
 *    buy a block of addresses from the IEEE Registration Authority for their production items. See "EUI" in the DW1000 User Manual.
 * 3. This timeout is for complete reception of a frame, i.e. timeout duration must take into account the length of the expected frame. Here the value
 *    is arbitrary but chosen large enough to make sure that there is enough time to receive a complete ACK frame sent by the "ACK DATA RX" example
 *    at the 110k data rate used (around 2 ms).
 * 4. In this example, receive buffer is set to the exact size of the only frame we want to handle but 802.15.4 UWB standard maximum frame length is
 *    127 bytes. DW1000 also supports an extended frame length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example..
 * 5. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW1000 OTP memory.
 * 6. TX to RX delay is set to 0 to activate reception immediately after transmission, as the companion "ACK DATA RX" example is configured to send
 *    the ACK immediately after reception of the frame sent by this example application.
 * 7. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of tx_msg as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our tx_msg could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 8. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW1000 User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
 * 9. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *    DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
