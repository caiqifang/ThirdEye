 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. Continuous frame mode is typically used to tune transmit power for regulatory purposes. This example has been designed to reproduce the use case
 *    of a tag blinking at a high rate: the blink length is around 180 µs in this configuration, emitted once per millisecond. In this configuration,
 *    the frame's transmission power can be increased while still complying with regulations. For more details about the management of TX power, the
 *    user is referred to DW1000 User Manual.
 * 2. The user is referred to DW1000 User Manual for references values applicable to different channels and/or PRF. Those reference values may need to
 *    be tuned for optimum performance and regulatory approval depending on the target product design.
 * 3. In this example, LDE microcode is not loaded upon calling dwt_initialise(). This will prevent the IC from generating an RX timestamp. If
 *    time-stamping is required, DWT_LOADUCODE parameter should be used. See two-way ranging examples (e.g. examples 5a/5b).
 * 4. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *    DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
