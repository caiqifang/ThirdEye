 *  @brief   RX using double buffering example code
 *
 *           This example keeps listening for any incoming frames, storing in a local buffer any frame received before going back to listening. This
 *           examples activates interrupt handling and the double buffering feature of the DW1000 (but automatic RX re-enabling is not supported).
 *           Frame processing and manual RX re-enabling are performed in the RX good frame callback.

 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. In this example, maximum frame length is set to 127 bytes which is 802.15.4 UWB standard maximum frame length. DW1000 supports an extended
 *    frame length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example.
 * 2. In this example, LDE microcode is not loaded upon calling dwt_initialise(). This will prevent the IC from generating an RX timestamp. If
 *    time-stamping is required, DWT_LOADUCODE parameter should be used. See two-way ranging examples (e.g. examples 5a/5b).
 * 3. Manual reception activation is performed here but DW1000 offers several features that can be used to handle more complex scenarios or to
 *    optimise system's overall performance (e.g. timeout after a given time, automatic re-enabling of reception in case of errors, etc.).
 * 4. There is nothing to do in the loop here as frame reception and RX re-enabling is handled by the callbacks. In a less trivial real-world
 *    application the RX data callback would generally signal the reception event to some background protocol layer to further process each RX frame.
 * 5. When using double buffering, RX can be re-enabled before reading all the frame data as this is precisely the purpose of having two buffers. All
 *    the registers needed to process the received frame are also double buffered with the exception of the Accumulator CIR memory and the LDE
 *    threshold (accessed when calling dwt_readdiagnostics). In an actual application where these values might be needed for any processing or
 *    diagnostics purpose, they would have to be read before RX re-enabling is performed so that they are not corrupted by a frame being received
 *    while they are being read. Typically, in this example, any such diagnostic data access would be done at the very beginning of the rx_ok_cb
 *    function.
 * 6. A real application might get an operating system (OS) buffer for this data reading and then pass the buffer onto a queue into the next layer
      of processing task via an appropriate OS call.
 * 7. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *    DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
